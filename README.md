# VesselWatch - Unlocking Insights from Maritime Data
## Project Description
VesselWatch empowers users to extract valuable insights from maritime data, including risk assessments and vessel activities. By leveraging GraphQL queries and robust security measures, the system facilitates efficient monitoring and analysis of vessel-related information.

## Tech used
- Python: The backbone of the backend development.
- Requests Library: Powering seamless HTTP requests to the GraphQL endpoint.
- GraphQLClient: Custom-built for smooth interaction with GraphQL endpoint.
- Asyncio: Fueling high-performance asynchronous programming.
- Tokenization: Ensuring secure authentication and access control.
- Logging: Keeping track of crucial events and errors for monitoring and debugging.
- Datetime: Managing date and time data efficiently.
- JSON: Serialization and deserialization of data in JSON format.
- Environment Variables: Safely storing sensitive information for enhanced security. 
## Future Plan
Integration with LLM Frameworks: Collaborate with LLM frameworks like Instructor to democratize access to maritime data. Simplifying data retrieval processes will make vessel monitoring more accessible to a wider audience.
